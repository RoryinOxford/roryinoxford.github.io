  <h1 style="text-align: center;">POLICIES AND TERMS</h1>
  <p>By participating in our tours, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to, the following policies, terms, and disclaimers.<br> Last updated 28th October 2024.</p>

  <h2>Cancellation and Refund Policies</h2>
  <h3>Change of Date (Shared Tours)</h3>
  <ul><li>You may request to change the date or time of your tour once, free of charge, provided that you give notice more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the tour. This request is subject to availability. Additional changes will be charged a £5 administrative fee per person.</li></ul>
  <h3>Cancelling Your Boooking (Shared Tours)</h3>
  <ul><li>If you cancel your tour more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time, you will receive a refund minus a £5 administrative fee per person. Booking and transaction fees cannot be refunded.</li><li>Unfortunately, refunds cannot be made for cancellations made less than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the tour.</li></ul>
  <h3>Cancellation and Refund Policies for Private Tours</h3>
  <ul><li>Different terms apply for different private tours. The following terms are valid only in default of terms set out for specific private tours. The terms for specific private tours may be found in invoices, email correspondence, and booking pages (but may be found in other places). Particular terms may be set for individual bookings. If there are no specific terms set out for your particular tour, the following terms apply.</li>
    <li>Constituent colleges of the University of Oxford, buildings owned or managed by the University of Oxford, and all other places of interest in Oxford that require entry fees, will be referred to as ‘places of interest’ ("POI", "POIs") throughout this webpage. The cost associated with gaining admission into POIs will be called the ‘entry fee’. </li>
  <li>Entry fees paid to Rory in Oxford cannot be refunded, unless in the event that Rory in Oxford cancels the tour in which these POIs were to be entered, or entry into those POIs is no longer available. In the event that the customer asks for a tour to be rearranged, then, if entry into those POIs is available, any entry fees must be repaid, or else the tour will continue without entering into the POIs. If a tour is rearranged, however, there is no guarantee that entry into any POIs.</li>
<li>75% of the amount paid for a tour (that is, not including entry fees) can be refunded if cancelled by the customer more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the tour. If no start time had been arranged before cancelation, the ‘scheduled start time of the tour’ is to be taken as 08.00 GMT on the day the tour had been scheduled for. No refunds can be offered if the tour is cancelled less than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the tour.</li>
<li>You may request to change the date or time of your tour once, free of charge, provided that you give notice more than 24 hours before the scheduled start time of the tour. This request is subject to availability. Additional changes will be charged a £50 administrative fee per booking. As specified above, entry into POIs cannot be rearranged in this manner. </li>
</ul>

  <h3>Tour Cancellation and Abandonments</h3>
  <ul><li>If Rory in Oxford has to cancel a tour, a full refund (minus booking and transaction fees) will be provided. Rory in Oxford reserves the right to cancel a tour for any reason, up to and after the tour’s scheduled start time. No additional compensation will be provided.</li><li>Refunds or partial refunds cannot be provided if you decide to leave the tour early, regardless of the reason.</li><li>Tours will go ahead in all weather conditions, so please come dressed suitably</li></ul>

  <h2>Tour Itinerary</h2>
  <h3>Shared Oxford University & City Tour</h3>
  <ul><li>Most of the stops on our tour are buildings owned, and constantly used, by the University of Oxford or its constituent colleges. All cities are unpredictable - and Oxford is no exception; for these, and other reasons, the itinerary for the shared Oxford University and City tour is subject to change without notice. The most important thing for me, is that you to have a brilliant tour, and I will always make sure that disruption is kept to an absolute minimum.</li><li>Tickets for the shared Oxford University and City tour include entry into one of either: 1) Divinity School or 2) Trinity College. The matter of which of these two options is decided upon, is a matter for Rory Kunz. If neither Divinity School or Trinity College are available, an alternative may be provided. Whether this is provided, is at the discresion of Rory Kunz. This substitution may be made without prior notice. The tour guide may determine the alternative as they see fit. If no alternative can be provided, a partial refund of £2.50 per ticket can be provided, on request. No more compensation or refund than this £2.50 per ticket can be given.</li></ul>
