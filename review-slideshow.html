          <div class="caption-text">"Touring with Rory was amazing!!! As a former student, he had all sorts of wonderful titbits to share about the University and the city! And, since we wanted to know more about CS Lewis and Tolkien, Rory was more than willing to point us to locations that reflected our interests (including the lampstand that may have featured in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe). We highly recommend touring with Rory – he is just so friendly, knowledgeable and kind.".<br><br><b><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d27968129-r969476422-Discover_Oxford_University_with_Recent_Graduate-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html">- Gen, TripAdvisor</a></b></div>

            <div class="caption-text-small">"We booked a tour with Rory on incredibly short notice but he was very kind and accommodating. The tour itself was personalized and he had very thoughtful answers to all our questions. We learned so much more with Rory than we would have otherwise and it felt like a much more personal experience being on a small tour rather than one of the large groups you see walking around. Rory gave us a ton of information about the town, the history of the University, and especially the student life and traditions since he’s a recent graduate. All in all this was a wonderful experience and I would recommend Rory’s tours to anyone visiting Oxford!".<br><br><b><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d27968129-r969977235-Discover_Oxford_University_with_Recent_Graduate-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html">- Paige, TripAdvisor</a></b></div>

              <div class="caption-text-small">"Rory is a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide. My fiancée and I were very impressed with his subject matter knowledge on the full spectrum of Oxford’s history, as well as the specific histories and traditions of the different Colleges. His tour didn’t just stick to the postcard talking points and included a lot of colour and flavour I feel you wouldn’t get from other tour guides. He enthusiastically answered all questions and provided us with very helpful recommendations on other activities we might do during our stay.I highly recommend his services.

Whereas it was titled a Harry Potter tour, our guide elaborated on much more than that… showing great film locations of the film and other historic places. I was worried if we could follow our guide to all locations, as my mum is in a wheelchair. but our guide made sure we could get access to all locations. We definitely liked the visit to the dining room of New College. A knowledgeable guide explaining things with clear and with a joke.".<br><br><b><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d27949743-r973101167-Rory_in_Oxford_Tours_of_Oxford_and_Oxford_University-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html">- Linde, TripAdvisor</a></b></div></div>

He is very knowledgeable about Oxford University (currently and historically) and told fun stories about each college/tour spot we passed.
