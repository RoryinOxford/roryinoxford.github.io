          <div class="caption-text">"Rory was a most delightful and informative guide. He toured us around the key sites of Oxford University, sharing stories of both the history of the university and first hand stories about student life and experience. Thanks for a fantastic tour Rory. We feel privileged to have experienced Oxford through your lived experience".<br><br><b>- Gai and Murray, Google Reviews</b></div>

          <div class="caption-text">"Touring with Rory was amazing!!! As a former student, he had all sorts of wonderful tidbits to share about the University and the city! And, since we wanted to know more about CS Lewis and Tolkien, Rory was more than willing to point us to locations that reflected our interests [...]. We highly recommend touring with Rory- he is just so friendly, knowledgable and kind".<br><br><b><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d27968129-r969476422-Discover_Oxford_University_with_Recent_Graduate-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html">Gen, TripAdvisor</a></b></div>

            <div class="caption-text-small">"We booked a tour with Rory on incredibly short notice but he was very kind and accommodating. The tour itself was personalized and he had very thoughtful answers to all our questions. We learned so much more with Rory than we would have otherwise and it felt like a much more personal experience being on a small tour rather than one of the large groups you see walking around. Rory gave us a ton of information about the town, the history of the University, and especially the student life and traditions since he’s a recent graduate. All in all this was a wonderful experience and I would recommend Rory’s tours to anyone visiting Oxford!".<br><br><b><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d27968129-r969977235-Discover_Oxford_University_with_Recent_Graduate-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html">- Paige, TripAdvisor</a></b></div>
