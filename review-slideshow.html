Rory skillfully tailored the tour to our interests, showcasing key attractions while weaving in fascinating insights about Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.<br><br>
            What really stood out was Rory's attention to detail and his ability to engage every member of our group, including our 8-year-old daughter. She absolutely loved the scavenger hunt he organized just for her, and the thoughtful small gift he gave her was a lovely touch.<br><br>
            The tour was informative, engaging, and perfectly paced. Rory’s passion and knowledge brought the history and stories of Oxford to life. We highly recommend him to anyone looking for a meaningful and personalized tour experience!

And, since we wanted to know more about CS Lewis and Tolkien, Rory was more than willing to point us to locations that reflected our interests (including the lampstand that may have featured in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe).

Being a recent grad his unique perspective felt current and… well, authentic. He is deeply knowledgeable and a great storyteller, at the same time he is laid back and very warm. He’s just great company. Rory’s is a relaxed but fact-packed tour.

We had a lovely informative tour and learnt a lot about the history of the colleges and buildings together with Rory's first hand stories of life as a recent student at Oxford, the college system and traditions and rituals. His end of tour leaflet is very helpful with information on what else may be enjoyed in Oxford, we went on to visit the Ashmolean Museum and then had tea in 'one' of the oldest tea rooms on the High Street (he will tell you the story) Thank you very much Rory and we wish you every success in your future plans."<br><br><b><a href="https://www.getyourguide.com/oxford-l441/oxford-university-city-walking-tour-with-recent-graduate-t836270/">- Janet, Get Your Guide</a></b></div>

            <div class="caption-text-large">"We booked a tour with Rory on incredibly short notice but he was very kind and accommodating. The tour itself was personalized and he had very thoughtful answers to all our questions. We learned so much more with Rory than we would have otherwise and it felt like a much more personal experience being on a small tour rather than one of the large groups you see walking around. Rory gave us a ton of information about the town, the history of the University, and especially the student life and traditions since he’s a recent graduate. All in all this was a wonderful experience and I would recommend Rory’s tours to anyone visiting Oxford!"<br><br><b><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186361-d27968129-r969977235-Discover_Oxford_University_with_Recent_Graduate-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html">- Paige, TripAdvisor</a></b></div>
